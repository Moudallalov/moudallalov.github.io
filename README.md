# Colors Portofolio Website
![alt tag](http://imgur.com/0q8QPri.png)

##Welcome to my super cool portfolio website.
This is a portfolio website for me worked from scratch.
It took about 3 weeks of work to complete (procrastination included).

###Open-Source Code
There was some open source code that I used in my website such as [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/), and some other code by tutorials from codrops, and tiny chunks of code from other websites.

###Inspiration
This website was inspired by [Cubezapp](https://github.com/unixpickle/cubezapp) website regarding colors and strangely by [Far Cry 4](far-cry.ubisoft.com/fc4/en-gb/home/) game regarding text borders and stuff.

###TODO
1. Work on mobile responsiveness
2. Update personal story (the full one)
3. Add more info to work and portfolio (more images and text)
4. Buy a domain name and switch to personal server
5. Fix the mail's php file in order to work after switching to the server

##Finally
At last, this was made open-source so all of you can check it out. But if someone wanted to use something from it, I'd be glad if I was referenced :D
